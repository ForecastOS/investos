    A constraint that enforces a limit on the (absolute) leverage of the portfolio.

    E.g. For leverage of 2.0x, a portfolio with 100MM net value
    (i.e. the portfolio value if it were converted into cash,
    ignoring liquidation / trading costs)
    could have 200MM of (combined long and short) exposure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    limit : float, optional
        The minimum weight of each asset in the portfolio. Defaults to -0.05.

    **kwargs :
        Additional keyword arguments.

        Parameters
        ----------
        t : datetime
            The current time.

        w_plus : series
