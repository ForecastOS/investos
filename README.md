Now called [ForecastOS](https://forecastos.com/guides/introduction/getting_started) Portfolio Management, is an opinionated framework for constructing and backtesting portfolios in a consistent, albeit flexible way. We built it to make institutional-grade backtesting and portfolio optimization simple, extensible, and open-source.
